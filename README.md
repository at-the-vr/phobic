## Phobic

</p>

Phobic is just a bunch of components that I thought to design with a11y and reusability in mind.

Made in NextJs with TailwindCSS, these are extensible components ready to use, possibly just copy-paste the styles instead of the whole component ðŸ˜‰

### List 

Phobic currently holds

1. [button](https://phobic.vercel.app/button)

2. [card](https://phobic.vercel.app/card)

3. [input](https://phobic.vercel.app/input)

4. [accordion](https://phobic.vercel.app/accordion)

## Development

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

then run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev 
# default hosts at 3000 port
```
